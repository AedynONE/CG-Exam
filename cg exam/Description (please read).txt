I've done as much as I can in Blender
post proccessing effect is depth of field, applied to the camera
shadows can be seen being produced by 2 lights in the scene (bright white light, and a dimmer red light)
I created a hair particle system to simulate grass and applied it to the ground plane
textures were created in Substance painter, using materials that I have rights to use without providing credit
